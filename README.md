# Natural-Language-Querry-
These projects were created while I was doing internship for Rodic Consultants.
This repository contains three variations of Natural language querry projects(like chat gpt)

This was a one month offline internship where my task was to create software for the company use.

The first folder contains app.py that has a gradio UI and can be used to querry personel files like pdf, txt and csv file

note: for this version to run we need to put docs and app.py in same folder and then run the file from command prompt by going into the directory where these files are saved
For instructions on how to run project refer to the docs file.

The second folder contains other two .py files for connecting to SQLite and SQL Server. These are also wrapped into functions so that company could connect the python program to .NET
