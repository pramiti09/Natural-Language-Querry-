# Natural-Language-Querry-
These projects were created while I was doing internship for Rodic Consultants.
This repository contains three variations of Natural language querry projects(like chat gpt)
the first folder contains app.py that has a gradio UI and can be used to querry personel files like pdf, txt and csv file
note: for this version to run we need to put docs and app.py in same folder and then rum the file from command prompt by going into the directory where these files are saved
For instructions on how to run project refer to the docs file.
